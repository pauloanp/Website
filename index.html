        >If my life was a storm, photography would be like a gust of wind, more
        like a breeze. It has only been in my life for a short period of time,
        yet it is one, if not my favourite way to express myself. It's an art
        form which has become quickly a passion.</c

        >I studied Arts at Francisco Franco highschool, having always been keen
        on drawing and arts in general. It was at the beggining of my second
        year on the course that I started to enjoy photography more, although
        from my smartphone. Nearing the end of my last year, and after being
        inspired by many artists and photographers alike, I bought my first
        DSLR, which is my current camera. I haven't stopped ever since.</c

        >I am currently studying Graphic Design at ESAC.CR. My artist side has
        ever more increased in my, and photography is now embedded into me.</c

      <p>
        My work is ever changing and in constant evolution, and I'm always
        searching for new grounds to walk upon.
